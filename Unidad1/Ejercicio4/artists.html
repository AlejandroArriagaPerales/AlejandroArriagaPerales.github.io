				    <div class=divisionartistas>
				    <p>The Art College in New Dehli has sponsored Hassum for his entire undergraduate career at the university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted and vibrant tones.

				    <div class=divisionartistas>
				    <p>A native of New Orleans, much of Jennifer’s work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, having grown up as a teenager in the post-flood years. Despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost.</p>

				    <div class=divisionartistas>
				    <p>LaVonne’s giant-sized paintings all around Chicago tell the story of love, nature, and conservation - themes that are central to her heart. LaVonne will share her love and skill of graffiti art on Monday’s schedule, as she starts the painting of a 20-foot high wall in the Rousseau Room of Hotel Contempo in front of a standing-room only audience in Art in Unexpected Places.</p>

				    <div class=divisionartistas>

				    <div class=divisionartistas>
				    <p>A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face of modern art at the university. Riley’s exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind’s eye. Riley will be speaking on the “Art of Abstract” during Thursday’s schedule.</p>
